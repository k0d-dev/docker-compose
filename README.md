# docker-compose
Welcome on my Docker Compose repository. Here you can find examples of `docker-compose.yml` from diferent apps that you can selfhost. Collection is based on this what I found on internet.

All you have to do is rename file of your favourite app on `docker-compose.yml` or execute `docker-compose` command with `-f <filename.yml>`

#### IMPORTANT
Before executing any file, please edit and adjust according to your own needs.

Enjoy and have fun! ;)
