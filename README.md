# docker-compose
Welcome on my Docker Compose templates repository. Here you can find examples of `docker-compose.yml` from diferent apps that you can selfhost on your local server. Collection is based on this what I found on internet.

# Installation
All you have to do is rename file of your favourite app on `docker-compose.yml` or execute `docker-compose` command with `-f <filename.yml>`


#### IMPORTANT
***Before executing any file, please edit and adjust according to your own needs. Some of files require IP address***


Enjoy and have fun! ;)
