# docker-compose
Welcome on my Docker Compose templates repository. Here you can find examples of `docker-compose.yml` from diferent apps that you can selfhost on your local server. Collection is based on this what I found on internet.

# Installation
All you have to do is rename file of your favourite app on `docker-compose.yml` or execute `docker-compose` command with `-f <filename.yml>`


#### IMPORTANT
***Before executing any file, please edit and adjust according to your own needs. Some of files require IP address or port that is already assigned to your other service that is already running.***


Enjoy and have fun! ;)
